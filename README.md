Projects developed at the Introduction to Machine Learning 2022 course in ETHZ. All of them were given the maximum grade.

### Task descriptions

**[Task 1a.](./Task%201)** Ridge regression with k-fold cross-validation

**[Task 1b.](./Task%201)** `Task 1a` + Feature transformation

**[Task 2.](./Task%202)** Data preprocessing, handling, imputation, and predicting with Gaussian Process Regressor

**[Task 3.](./Task%203)** Similarity information between image triplets with Neural Networks

**[Task 4.](./Task%204)** Given a triplet of food images (a, p, n), choose an image between p and n that is more similar to a
