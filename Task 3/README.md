### Task 3: Trainning Neural Networks for similarity classification

- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction:** The code preprocesses images, resizing and normalizing them, and then extracts embeddings using a pretrained ResNet50 model.

- **Data Loading and Label Generation:** It loads triplets of images from text files and generates features and labels for training and testing. Features are created by concatenating embeddings of anchor, positive, and negative images.

- **Model Definition and Training:** The script defines a neural network for binary classification and trains it using binary cross-entropy loss. It monitors validation loss to save the best model.

- **Testing and Results:** The trained model is used to make predictions on test data, and the results are saved to "results.txt".  This file contains binary predictions (0 or 1) indicating whether the anchor and positive images in each test triplet are related.

**Customization:** This code serves as a flexible framework for image-based classification tasks. To adapt it to your specific project, you can customize data loading, adjust the model architecture, and fine-tune hyperparameters as needed. It's particularly useful for tasks involving image similarity or classification, such as image retrieval and recommendation systems.
