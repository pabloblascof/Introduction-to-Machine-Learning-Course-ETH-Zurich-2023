### Task 4: Transfer learning for HOMO-LUMO Gap prediction of molecules

The main objective of this task is to create a model that predicts the HOMO-LUMO gap of a molecule, using a small dataset with this information and a large dataset with similar data that can be leveraged for the main objective. Our solution fixes on creating a neural network capable of accurately predicting LUMO values for the large data set, and then using this NN to extract features from the main dataset for the regression model that predicts the HOMO-LUMO gap:

- **Data Loading:** The script loads the necessary data from CSV files, including pretraining features, labels, training features, labels, and test features.

- **Feature Extractor (Neural Network Model):** The script defines a neural network model used to extract meaningful features from the data. This model contains fully connected layers with batch normalization and dropout.

- **Feature Extractor Training:** The script includes a function to train the feature extractor on the pretraining data. It sets up data loaders, loss functions, and optimizers, and it monitors training and validation loss. The best model parameters are saved.

- **Feature Extraction Function:** A function called `make_features` is provided to extract features from both training and test data using the trained feature extractor.

- **Pretraining Class:** The script defines a class, `PretrainedFeatures`, that encapsulates the feature extraction process. This class is compatible with scikit-learn pipelines and can be used for feature extraction in a structured manner.

- **Regression Model:** The script includes a function to define a regression model. In this example, it uses Ridge regression, but you can customize it to use other regression algorithms.

- **Main Function:** The main part of the script loads the data, pretrains the feature extractor, trains the regression model, and makes predictions. It implements a complete pipeline that includes feature extraction, feature standardization, hyperparameter tuning for the regression model, and saving the best model parameters.

This script provides a comprehensive framework for a machine learning pipeline, from feature extraction to regression, and can be customized for specific datasets and tasks. It's a valuable resource for projects involving feature engineering and regression modeling.
